Most of the files in this directory are automatically generated
by glade.  Only callbacks.c contains functions to be edited by
the programmer.  To modify the GUI, you must have Glade installed,
then run it on the .glade file in the parent directory.  After
using Glade's GUI-editing GUI, you can click "Build" to re-create
the files in this directory to match the new GUI layout.
