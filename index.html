<p> xoscope (or oscope) is a digital oscilloscope for
Linux!<p> </center>

<p> Click the image for a full 1152 x 864 screenshot where I have XY
mode running and many of the menus torn off for you to see (v1.6).<p>

<h2>2009 Jun 26: Version 2.0 is released</h2>

Version 2.0 is a major release, and the first xoscope release to use
GTK+ 2.0 exclusively.  SVGA is no longer supported.  In addition to a
cleaner, more modern organization of the source code, the major user
visible change is a long-requested feature: the ability to scroll
through signals too wide to fit on the screen.

<h2>2005 Jun 28: Version 1.12 is released</h2>

Version 1.12 is a bug-fix release.  Major new features in version 1.10 were:<p>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.comedi.org">COMEDI</A> support
<LI>Ability to use parallel port for digital data collection
<LI>Improved performance under X Windows
<LI>More modular data source interface
</UL>

See the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=7547&release_id=168561">Release Notes</A> for more information<P>

Bitscope and Probescope support has not been tested in version 1.10+,
due to a lack of the necessary hardware by the primary developer.  If
you have a Bitscope or a Probescope, and experience problems with
version 1.12, try version 1.8.  Even better, please become a developer
and debug version 1.12 on these devices!


<h2>2004 Nov 4: Version 1.11 is released</h2>

<h2>2003/06/30: Version 1.10 is released</h2>

<h2>2001/05/20: Version 1.8 is released</h2>

Please ignore the harmless configure error about src/Makefile.in.<p>

If make complains about vga.h, please use <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/~checkout~/xoscope/xoscope/configure">this
fixed configure script</a> (or <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/xoscope/xoscope/configure.diff?r1=1.2%3ARel1_8&tr1=1.1&r2=text&tr2=1.5&diff_format=c">patch</a>)
and let me know if it still doesn't work.<p>

If make complains about ESD_DEFAULT_RATE, replace the two occurences
in sc_linux.c with 44100.<p>
<p>

Uggh.  Maybe I'll figure out how to get configure to figure all this
out someday...<p>

	NEW for 1.8:

<ul>
  <li> Standard GNU-style `./configure ; make' automated build process.

  <li> Samples are now collected in parallel to display refresh for audio
  and bitscope devices.

  <li> This has enabled much longer sweep times: up to 2 sec/division!

  <li> Memory buffers increased to 256K to support such slow sweeps.
  Memories now store time zero to current display point and file
  length is as long as longest memory.

  <li> New step display mode, hit the ! key.

  <li> Under GTK, mouse cursors are now draggable while left button
  decreases and middle button increases the variable pointed to.
  Right menu still pops up the context-sensitive menu.

  <li> Basic limited bitscope data capture at a fixed sample rate.  If a
  BitScope is identified, it is used exclusively, turning off sound
  and ProbeScope input devices.  It connects BitScope Channel A, B and
  LA to X, Y and Z respectively.
</ul>

<h2>BitScope!</h2>

I am finally working on connecting <a
href="http://www.bitscope.com/">BitScope</a> to xoscope.  You can snag
the latest development code from <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=7547">CVS</a>.

This mixed signal capture engine is an "Open Hardware" RS-232 serial
device that has the potential to turn xoscope into a real combined
digital scope and logic analyzer at up to 100 MHz for just a few $ in
hardware.  Check out the BitScope site for more details.  Sorry for
the long delay; I was too busy building aircraft until now.  :-)<p>
