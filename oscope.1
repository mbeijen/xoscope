.TH OSCOPE 1 "June  1  2000" "Linux" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
oscope xoscope \- Digital Oscilloscope via Sound Card and/or ProbeScope/osziFOX
.SH SYNOPSIS
oscope [oscope options] [file]
.br
xoscope [toolkit options] [oscope options] [file]

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B Oscope
is a digital real-time oscilloscope. It graphically displays signal
amplitude as a function of time. The input is via a sound card and/or
a serial port connected to a Radio Shack ProbeScope, Cat. No. 22-310.
This device is also known as an osziFOX.  Either or both input devices
may be used at the same time.  Signals may be displayed, saved,
recalled, and manipulated by math functions.
.P

Some of the controls below apply only to the sound card and are
labeled as such.
.B Oscope
has no physical control over the ProbeScope/osziFOX which is
controlled by its own switches and built-in menus.  Please refer to
your ProbeScope or osziFOX Owner's Manual for operating instructions.
.P
.B Oscope
can be built with EsounD (Enlightened Sound Daemon) support for
sharing a sound device among programs or over the network.  See the
.B ENVIRONMENT
section below for more details.

.PP
.SH "RUN\-TIME KEYBOARD CONTROLS"

.B Oscope
is an interactive program and can be completely controlled from the
keyboard at run-time.  In verbose key help mode, each available key is
shown on the screen in (parentheses).  The following single key
commands are available:

.TP 0.5i
.B ?
Toggle verbose key help display mode.

.TP 0.5i
.B Escape
Immediately quit the program.

.TP 0.5i
.B @
Load a previously saved file.  You are prompted for the filename.

.TP 0.5i
.B #
Save current settings and memory buffers to a file that can be loaded
later.  You are prompted for the filename and asked for confirmation
to overwrite if it already exists.

.TP 0.5i
.B Enter
Clear and refresh the entire screen.

.TP 0.5i
.B ^
Toggle the ProbeScope input device on/off.  The ProbeScope is turned
on only if it is found active on a serial port.  This may be useful if
the ProbeScope wasn't detected at startup.  See the
.B ENVIRONMENT
section below for more details.

.TP 0.5i
.B &
Toggle the sound card input device on/off.

.TP 0.5i
.B *
Cycle the sound card DMA divisor: 4, 2, 1.  The sound driver will
divide it's DMA buffer by this factor.  The value 4 usually gives the
fastest display rate.

Under EsounD, this value instead determines whether the connection to
EsounD will block (4) or not (2 or 1).  Blocking mode is nicest to CPU
usage but the
.B oscope
interface will not respond when the there is no sound stream coming
from EsounD.  Nonblocking mode will let
.B oscope
be responsive whether sound is available or not, but will consume all
available CPU cycles.

.TP 0.5i
.B (/)
Decrease/increase the sound card sampling rate.

.TP 0.5i
.B 9/0
Increase/decrease the Sec/Div horizontal time scale (zoom out/in on
time).

.TP 0.5i
.B -/=
Decrease/increase the sound card trigger level.

.TP 0.5i
.B _
Toggle the sound card trigger channel: X or Y.

.TP 0.5i
.B +
Cycle the sound card trigger type: automatic, rising edge, or falling
edge.

.TP 0.5i
.B Space
Cycle the trigger mode of the sound card: run, wait, stop.  Run mode
continuously acquires and displays samples after trigger events.  Wait
mode waits for the first trigger event and displays only the first set
of samples; this is "single-shot" mode.  Stop mode suspends the data
acquisition and displays the current samples.

.TP 0.5i
.B !
Cycle the plotting mode: point, point accumulate, line, or line
accumulate.  In the accumulate modes, all samples stay on the screen;
use
.B Enter
to clear them.

.TP 0.5i
.B ,
Cycle the graticule style: none, minor divisions only, or minor and
major divisions.

.TP 0.5i
.B .
Toggle the graticule position: behind or in front of the signals.

.TP 0.5i
.B </>
Decrease/increase the graticule color.

.TP 0.5i
.B '
Toggle the manual cursors on/off.  When manual cursors are displayed,
the measurements between the cursor positions are shown.  When cursors
are not displayed, automatic measurements are shown.

.TP 0.5i
.B """
Reset both manual cursor positions to the sample just after trigger.
.\" "

.TP 0.5i
.B Ctrl-q/w/e/r
The Control key held down in combination with q/w/e/r moves the first
cursor back or forward by 10 samples or back or forward by 1 sample
respectively.

.TP 0.5i
.B Ctrl-a/s/d/f
The Control key held down in combination with a/s/d/f moves the second
cursor back or forward by 10 samples or back or forward by 1 sample
respectively.

.TP 0.5i
.B 1\-8
Select the corresponding display channel.  Measurements are displayed
for the channel.  Channel 1 and 2 are used as input to the math
functions so they can't be used to do math.  By default, they are
connected to the Left (X) and Right (Y) sound channels, as controlled
by an external mixer program.  Channel 1 and 2 can also be used to
display memory buffers or ProbeScope (Z) input for doing math on
memory or ProbeScope signals respectively.  Channel 3 through 8 are
not restricted and can be used for any purpose.  By default, the
ProbeScope (Z) input is connected to Channel 3.  The remaining single
key commands operate on the currently selected channel:

.TP 0.5i
.B Tab
Toggle visibility: Hide or show the selected channel.

.TP 0.5i
.B {/}
Decrease/Increase vertical scale of the selected channel.

.TP 0.5i
.B [/]
Decrease/Increase vertical position of the selected channel.

.TP 0.5i
.B `/~
Decrease/Increase number of logic analyzer bits displayed.  The
default of zero bits plots the signal as one analog line of varying
amplitude.  Any other value plots multiple digital lines representing
the least significant bits from bottom to top.

.TP 0.5i
.B ;/:
Increase/Decrease the math function of the selected channel.  This is
not available on channel 1 & 2.

.TP 0.5i
.B $
Show the result of an external math command on the selected channel.
You are prompted for the command.  The command must accept samples of
channel 1 & 2 on stdin and write a new signal to stdout.  See operl,
offt.c and xy.c in the distribution for examples of external math
filter commands.  Not available on channel 1 & 2.

.TP 0.5i
.B A-W
Store the currently selected channel into the corresponding memory
buffer.  Buffer X, Y and Z can't be used because they're reserved as
the Left (X) and Right (Y) sound inputs and ProbeScope (Z) input.

.TP 0.5i
.B a-z
Recall the corresponding memory buffer or input device to the
currently selected channel.  Buffer X is the Left sound input, Y is
the Right sound input, and Z is ProbeScope input.  The rest of the
buffers are available for signal memory.

.PP
.SH "MOUSE CONTROLS"
.B Xoscope
adds mouse controls to menus or around the edges of the scope area.
These should be nearly self-explanatory.  They perform the same
functions as the equivalent keyboard commands above.  If built with
GTK+, context-sensitive pop-up menus are available to select channels,
change scale and position, recall and store signals and so on.  The
manual measurement cursors can also be positioned with the mouse.

.PP
.SH "COMMAND\-LINE OPTIONS"

The command-line options define the startup state of
.B oscope
and have reasonable defaults.  All options may be capitalized in case
they conflict with an X toolkit option.

.TP 0.5i
.B -h
Help usage message showing these startup options with their default
values, then exit.

.TP 0.5i
.B -# <code>
Startup conditions of each channel.  # is a channel number from 1 to
8.  Code can have up to three fields, separated by colons:
position[.bits][:scale[:function #, memory letter, or external
command]].  Position is the number of pixels above (positive) or below
(negative) the center of the display.  Bits is the number of logic
analyzer bits to display.  Scale is a valid scaling factor from 1/50
to 50, expressed as a fraction.  The third field may contain a
built-in math function number, memory letter, or external math command
to run on the channel.  Using these options makes the channel visible
unless position begins with a '+', in which case the channel is
hidden.

.TP 0.5i
.B -a <channel>
Active, or selected, channel.

.TP 0.5i
.B -r <rate>
Sound card sampling Rate in samples per second.  Current valid values
are 8000, 11025, 22050, or 44100.

.TP 0.5i
.B -s <scale>
Time Scale factor from 1/20 to 1000 expressed as a fraction where 1/1
is 1 ms/div.

.TP 0.5i
.B -t <trigger>
Sound card Trigger conditions.  Trigger can have up to three fields,
separated by colons: position[:type[:channel]].  Position is the
number of pixels above (positive) or below (negative) the center of
the display.  Type is a number indicating the kind of trigger, 0 =
automatic, 1 = rising edge, 2 = falling edge.  Channel should be x or
y.

.TP 0.5i
.B -l <cursors>
Manual cursor Line positions.  Cursors can have up to three fields,
separated by colons: first[:second[:on?]].  First is the sample
position of the first cursor.  Second is the sample position of the
second cursor.  The final field is weather the manual cursors are
displayed (1) or the not displayed (0).

.TP 0.5i
.B -c <color>
Graticule Color, 0 - 15.

.TP 0.5i
.B -d <dma divisor>
Divisor for sound card DMA: 1, 2, or 4.  The sound driver will divide
it's DMA buffer by this factor.  The value 4 usually gives the fastest
display rate.

.TP 0.5i
.B -m <mode>
Graphics Mode to use.  For
.B xoscope,
use the more flexible -geometry instead.  0 = 640x480x16, 1 =
800x600x16, 2 = 1024x768x16, 3 = 1280x1024x16.
.B WARNING:
not all modes are supported by all video cards; don't use unsupported
modes!

.TP 0.5i
.B -f
Font to use.  For
.B oscope,
these are listed in /usr/lib/kbd/consolefonts.  For
.B xoscope,
they're the output of xlsfonts.  The default should work best.

.TP 0.5i
.B -p <type>
Plot type.  0 = point, 1 = point accumulate, 2 = line, 3 = line
accumulate.

.TP 0.5i
.B -g <style>
Graticule style.  0 = none, 1 = minor divisions only, 2 = minor and
major divisions.

.TP 0.5i
.B -b
Whether the graticule is drawn Behind or in front of the signals.

.TP 0.5i
.B -v
Whether the Verbose key help is displayed.

.TP 0.5i
.B -x
Whether the sound card input device (XY) is turned on.

.TP 0.5i
.B -z
Whether the ProbeScope input device (Z) is turned on.

.TP 0.5i
.B file
The name of a file to load upon startup.  This should be a file
previously saved by
.B oscope.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP 0.5i
.B oscope -1 80 -2 -80 -3 0:1/5:6 -4 -160:1/5:7

This runs
.B oscope
with channel 1 above and channel 2 below the center of the display.
Also channel 3 and 4 are made visible to show the FFT of channel 1 and
2 respectively at a reduced scale of 1/5.

.TP 0.5i
.B xoscope oscope.dat

This runs xoscope, loading settings and memory buffers from a
previously saved data file called "oscope.dat".

.SH FILES
.B Oscope
creates readable text data files.  The files contain at least a
comment header which holds the current settings of
.B oscope.
Loading the file causes these saved settings to be restored.

To record your signals permanently first store them into memory
buffers, optionally recall them to channels, and then save the file.
All non-empty memory buffers are written to a column of the file
following the comment header.  Columns are separated by tab
characters.  These are stored back into the memory buffers when the
file is later loaded.  Simply recall them to channels to view them.
.P

This format could also be read by some spreadsheet or plotting
programs.  For example, the
.B gnuplot (1)
command
.P

plot "oscope.dat" using 0:1, "oscope.dat" using 0:2
.P

would plot the first and second columns of the "oscope.dat" data file.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.TP 0.5i
.B OSCOPEPATH
The path to use when looking for external math commands.  If unset,
the built-in default is used.

.TP 0.5i
.B PROBESCOPE
The serial device your ProbeScope or osziFOX is connected to.  If no
ProbeScope is found here, some known serial devices are checked.  If
unset, "/dev/probescope" is used.  /dev/probescope could be a symbolic
link to the real device such as /dev/ttyS1.

.TP 0.5i
.B ESPEAKER
The host:port of the EsounD to connect to if built with EsounD
support.  If unset, localhost is assumed.  If no EsounD connection is
made or if there is no EsounD support compiled in, then
.B oscope
will try to read /dev/dsp directly.

.SH LIMITATIONS

The sound card should be capable of 44100 Hz sampling via the sound
drivers.  You must use an external mixer program to select the input
source device, level, etc.  Since these unknowns affect the amplitude,
there is no reference to voltage on the Y axis; it is in fact,
unknown.  Instead you're given the scale in pixels per sample unit.
Note that the ProbeScope/osziFOX doesn't have this limitation.
ProbeScope signals have a real voltage label on the Y axis.
.P

Signal math is only valid if Channel 1 and 2 contain signals of the
same sampling rate.
.B It is up to you to make sure this is the case.  Doing math on signals
.B of different sample rates will produce incorrect results!
.P

The automatic measurements count zero crossings and divide to
determine the frequency and period.  If these zero crossings are not
"regularly-periodic", these measurements could be invalid.
.B Oscope
does understand how to measure the built-in FFT functions by locating
the peak frequency.  Use manual cursor positioning to get more precise
measurements.
.P

Your sound card is most-likely AC coupled so you will never see any DC
offset.  You probably can't get DC coupling by just shorting the input
capacitors on your sound card.  Use ProbeScope to see DC offsets.
.P

The display may not be able to keep up if you give it too much to
plot, depending on your sound card, graphics card, and processor
speed.  External math commands are particularly expensive since the
kernel must then split the available CPU cycles across multiple
processes.  To maximize refresh speed, hide all unneeded channels, use
point or point accumulate mode, zoom in on Sec/Div as much as
possible, and turn off the graticule.
.P

Because it uses svgalib,
.B oscope
must be run as root or be setuid to root.
.B xoscope
doesn't have this restriction.

.SH BUGS
The keyboard interface may be confusing.
