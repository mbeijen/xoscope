.TH OSCOPE 1 "April 1  1996" "Linux" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
oscope xoscope \- Digital Oscilloscope for /dev/dsp
.SH SYNOPSIS
oscope [oscope options] [file]
.br
xoscope [X toolkit options] [oscope options] [file]

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B Oscope
is a digital real-time oscilloscope. It graphically displays amplitude
as a function of time. The input is via a sound card using the kernel
sound device /dev/dsp.

.PP
.SH "RUN\-TIME CONTROLS"
.PP

.B Oscope
is an interactive program and can be completely controlled from the
keyboard at run-time.  Each available key is shown on the screen in
(parentheses).  The following single key commands are available:

.TP 0.5i
.B Escape
Immediately quit the program.

.TP 0.5i
.B @
Load a previously saved file.  You are prompted for the filename
unless your
.B oscope
can't display text.  In that case, the filename used is the one given
on the command line, or a default name.

.TP 0.5i
.B #
Save current settings and memory buffers to a file that can be loaded
later.  You are prompted for the filename unless your
.B oscope
can't display text.  In that case, the filename used is the one given
on the command line, or a default name.
.B WARNING:
This will overwrite existing files so be careful.

.TP 0.5i
.B Enter
Clear and refresh the entire screen.

.TP 0.5i
.B Space
Toggle Run/Stop: pauses or continues the acquiring of new samples.

.TP 0.5i
.B !
Cycle the plotting mode: point, point accumulate, line, or line
accumulate.

.TP 0.5i
.B 9/0
Increase/decrease the Sec/Div horizontal time scale.

.TP 0.5i
.B -/=
Decrease/increase the trigger level.

.TP 0.5i
.B _
Toggle the trigger channel: 1 or 2.

.TP 0.5i
.B +
Cycle the trigger type: none, rising edge, or falling edge.

.TP 0.5i
.B &
Cycle the graticule style: none, minor divisions only, or minor and
major divisions.

.TP 0.5i
.B *
Toggle the graticule position: behind or in front of the signals.

.TP 0.5i
.B (/)
Decrease/increase the graticule color.

.TP 0.5i
.B ,/.
Decrease/increase the DMA divisor.  Higher values will usually give
the fastest display rate.

.TP 0.5i
.B 1\-8
Select the corresponding channel.  Auto-measurements are displayed.
Channel 1 and 2 are always the Left and Right sound channels, as
controlled by an external mixer program.  Channel 3 through 8 are
software channels that can each display a math function or the
contents of one of 26 memory buffers.  The remaining single key
commands operate on the currently selected channel:

.TP 0.5i
.B Tab
Toggle visibility: Hide or show the selected channel.

.TP 0.5i
.B {/}
Decrease/Increase vertical position of the selected channel.

.TP 0.5i
.B [/]
Decrease/Increase vertical scale of the selected channel.

.TP 0.5i
.B ;/:
Increase/Decrease the math function of the selected channel.  Not
available on channel 1 & 2.

.TP 0.5i
.B A-Z
Store the currently selected channel into the corresponding memory
buffer.  This is only available when the sampling rate is 44000.

.TP 0.5i
.B a-z
Recall the corresponding memory buffer onto the currently selected
channel.  Not available on channel 1 & 2.

.PP
.SH "MOUSE CONTROLS"
.B Xoscope
adds mouse controls around the edges of the scope area.  These are
color coded and should be self-explanatory.  They perform the same
functions as the corresponding keyboard commands above.

.PP
.SH "COMMAND\-LINE OPTIONS"

All these options may also be capitalized in case they conflict with
an X toolkit option.

.TP 0.5i
.B -h
Produce a usage message showing these startup options with their
default values, then exit.

.TP 0.5i
.B -# <code>
Specify the startup conditions of the channel.  # is a channel number
from 1 to 8.  Code can have up to four fields, separated by colons:
position[:scale[:function#[:visible]]].  Position is the number of
pixels above (positive) or below (negative) the center of the display.
Scale is a valid scaling factor from 1/200 to 200.  Function number is
the math function to perform on the channel or the memory letter to
recall to the channel.  Visible should be 0 to hide the channel.

.TP 0.5i
.B -a <channel>
Specify the selected, or active, channel.

.TP 0.5i
.B -r <rate>
Specify the sampling rate in samples per second.  Current valid values
are 8800, 22000, or 44000.

.TP 0.5i
.B -s <scale>
Sets the time scale factor, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 100, or 200.

.TP 0.5i
.B -t <trigger>
Sets the initial trigger conditions.  Trigger can have up to three
fields, separated by colons: position[:type[:channel]].  Position is
the number of pixels above (positive) or below (negative) the center
of the display.  Type is a number indicating the kind of trigger, 0 =
none, 1 = rising edge, 2 = falling edge.  Channel should be 1 or 2.

.TP 0.5i
.B -c <color>
Sets the graticule color, 0 - 15.

.TP 0.5i
.B -m <mode>
Sets the graphics mode to use on the console.  For
.B xoscope,
use the more flexible -geometry instead.  0 = 640x480x16, 1 =
800x600x16, 2 = 1024x768x16, 3 = 1280x1024x16.
.B WARNING:
not all modes are supported by all video cards; don't use unsupported
modes!

.TP 0.5i
.B -d <dma divisor>
Sets the divisor for DMA buffer size, 1, 2, or 4.  The kernel sound
driver will divide it's DMA buffer by this factor.  The value 4
usually gives the fastest display rate.

.TP 0.5i
.B -f
Font to use.  For
.B oscope,
these are listed in /usr/lib/kbd/consolfonts.  For
.B xoscope,
they're the output of xlsfonts.  The default should work best.

.TP 0.5i
.B -p <type>
Plot type.  0 = point, 1 = point accumulate, 2 = line, 3 = line
accumulate.

.TP 0.5i
.B -g <style>
Graticule style.  0 = none, 1 = minor divisions only, 2 = minor and
major divisions.

.TP 0.5i
.B -b
Whether the graticule is drawn behind or in front of the signals.

.B file
The name of a file to load upon startup.  This should be a file
previously saved by 

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP 0.5i
.B oscope -1 80 -2 -80 -3 0:1/100:1 -4 -160:1/100:2

This runs
.B oscope
with channel 1 above and channel 2 below the center of the display.
Also channel 3 and 4 are made visible to show the FFT of channel 1 and
2 respectively at a reduced scale of 1/100.

.TP 0.5i
.B oscope oscope.osp

This runs oscope, loading settings and memory buffers from a
previously saved data file called "oscope.osp".

.SH FILES
.B Oscope
creates readable text data files.  The files contain at least a
comment header which holds the current settings of
.B oscope.
Loading the file causes these saved settings to be restored.

To record your signals permanently first Store them into memory
buffers, optionally recall them to channels, and then Save the file.
All non-empty memory buffers are written to a column of the file
following the comment header.  Columns are separated by tab
characters.  These are stored back in to the memory buffers when the
file is loaded.  Simply recall them to channels to view them.
.P

This format could also be read by some spreadsheet or plotting
programs.  For example, the
.B gnuplot (1)
command
.P

plot "oscope.osp" using 0:1, "oscope.osp" using 0:2
.P

would plot the first and second columns of the "oscope.osp" data file.

.SH PORTABILITY
.B Oscope
was written specifically for Linux, and uses the Linux sound driver
and svgalib or libsx plotting routines.  You need a sound card capable
of 44000 Hz sampling via the Linux kernel sound drivers.

.SH BUGS/LIMITATIONS
.PP
This should be considered BETA software.  It was basically written for
fun but should actually be useful for audio frequencies only.

Because it uses svgalib,
.B oscope
must be run as root or setuid to root.
.B xoscope
doesn't have this restriction.

The display may not be able to keep up when you give it too much to
plot, depending on your sound card, graphics card, and processor
speed.  Floating point math is used only by the FFT, so a math
coprocessor shouldn't make much difference.  To optimize refresh
speed, hide all unneeded channels, use point or point accumulate mode,
zoom in on Sec/Div as much as possible, and turn off the graticule.

You have to use an external mixer program to select the input source
device, level, etc.  Since these unknowns affect the amplitude, there
is no reference to voltage on the Y axis; it is in fact, unknown.
Instead you're given the scale in pixels per sample unit.

Enhancements that could be added: 16 bit sampling, single shot mode,
envelope mode, log scales and window functions for the FFT.  If you
really want a Spectrum Analyzer with more options, get "freq" by
Philip VanBaren.
