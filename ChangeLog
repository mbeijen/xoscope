Sun May  4 21:31:56 1997  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* sc_linux.c: Fixed bug that caused sound to fail to open.

	* TODO, oscope.lsm, README, config.h, sc_sb.c: For 1.3.

	* display.h: Exported the init_widgets function to oscope.c

	* oscope.h: Exported some init functions for file.c.

	* oscope.1, sc_linux.c, display.c, file.c:
	Removed the ability to change DMA on the fly since it requires closing
	and reopening the device; I want to open once and keep it open.

	* gr_sx.c: Tossed loadfile and savefile; just hit_keys instead.

	* func.c: Set signal colors to 0 on initialization.

	* file.c:
	Reinitialize everything before loading a file.  This is to clear all
	memories and functions so they're not still around after the load.

Sat May  3 16:15:57 1997  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* func.h, func.c, oscope.h, oscope.c, file.c, gr_sx.c:
	Moved command and pid into the channel structure.  Removed some unused
	variables from header files.

	* sc_sb.c: Updated for 1.3 again.

	* oscope.1: Fixed -s docs.

	* sc_linux.c, oscope.h:
	Moved buffer and junk into sc_linux.c, the only place they're used.

	* oscope.c, sc_linux.c:
	Improved the way the sound card gets reset.  Eliminated the `actual'
	global var; scope.rate now holds the actual sample rate correctly.

	* file.c: Enhanced -s to allow fractional values, using new scope.div.

	* display.c: Fixed bug in the bounds limit of the delay calculation.

Fri May  2 06:01:11 1997  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* gr_sx.c: Added an XY button to make xy easier to start.

	* display.c:
	Added a bogus math warning message when Channel 1 and 2 are at
	different sample rates.

	* oscope.h, display.c, oscope.c:
	Added scope.div.  This allows skipping of samples to see more time.

Thu May  1 04:49:25 1997  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* sc_linux.c, oscope.1, func.h, oscope.h, gr_sx.c, func.c, display.c, file.c, oscope.c:
	Major internal changes: Left and Right sound inputs are no longer
	"hard-wired" to the 1st and 2nd displays.  This was implemented as
	follows: The 8 displays were changed to new Channel stuctures.  There
	are now 34 static Signal structures: 23 memories, left input, right
	input, one reserved, and 8 functions.  One element of the Channel
	structure points to the Signal structure being displayed by that
	Channel.  Some appropriate display, control, and file I/O tweaks were
	made to support all this.  Several former limitations are now lifted.

	* Makefile: Added some DJGPP lines, renamed some files.

Tue Apr 29 05:08:18 1997  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* sc_sb.c:
	Tossed commented junk.  Updated for 1.3.  Still doesn't work.

Sat Apr 26 01:55:03 1997  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* display.c:
	Enhanced draw_data to work with arbitrary sample rates.  It does this
	by determining which sample, if any, should be plotted at each time
	position on the display.

	* sc_sb.c: Initial revision

Sun Feb 23 05:24:40 1997  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* gr_grx.c: Initial revision

	* file.c:

	* xy.c: Added quit button and plot mode menu.

	* TODO, Makefile, oscope.1, config.h, oscope.h, x11.c, file.c, oscope.c, display.c:
	Made the display less verbose by default.  All non-essential text is
	suppressed.  Hitting '?' toggles the extra text on/off.  -v command
	line / file option will make the display verbose at startup.

	* oscope.h, oscope.c, x11.c:
	Enhanced to support the new display-independent display.c.

	* display.h, display.c:
	Pulled VGA specific code out into new vga.c for easier maintenance.
	Now this file is completely display independent, leaving it up to the
	final link to provide all the display-specific functions.

	* vga.c: Initial revision

Sat Oct  5 21:12:45 1996  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* file.c: Overwriting an existing file now requires confirmation.

	* display.c: Added GetYesNo for svgalib.

	* x11.c: Added Run, Wait, Stop buttons to support new single-shot mode.

Fri Oct  4 05:14:02 1996  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* xy.c: Initial revision

	* display.c:
	Optimized draw_data for at least 2x performance improvement.  The
	problem was the color was being toggled for each sample in one
	erase/plot loop.  Now we set color, erase all, set color, plot all.

	* x11.c, func.c:
	Fixed bug: cleanup could call free on a NULL pointer (seg fault).

Fri Sep  6 03:53:59 1996  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* pcb.ps, pcb.fig, buff2.ps, buff2.fig: Initial revision

Sat Aug  3 23:14:57 1996  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* ChangeLog: 1.1 released.

	* oscope.lsm: For 1.1.

	* HARDWARE, TODO, README.freq51, freq51.patch, buff.ps, buff.fig:
	Initial revision

	* README: Updated for 1.1 release.

	* Makefile:
	Updates for the new external command path and other changes.

	* oscope.1: Updated for 1.1 release.

	* offt.c:
	Renamed oscope.fft to offt for easier typing (comment change only).

	* operl:
	Fixed bug in the delay example; it was being delayed by $x instead of $t.

Tue Jul 30 05:42:58 1996  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* display.c:
	Fixed bug: in accumulate modes, the current set of data would be drawn
	incorrectly just after a S/s change.  Optimized the draw_data loops.

Sat Jul 27 05:43:18 1996  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* fft.c: Synched with freq51.

Fri Jul 12 03:02:27 1996  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* oscope.c, display.c:
	First sample is now the one just before trigger, second the one after.
	We "connect" these samples with a straight line to more accurately
	guess where the trigger really was.  All samples are then shifted
	horizontally to position the trigger at time zero.  This greatly
	improves the horizontal resolution of high frequency signals in either
	of the accumulate modes.  This is best used by placing the trigger at
	0 where the linear approximation is most correct.

Sat Apr 27 17:47:21 1996  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	Channels displaying a memory buffer are now automatically updated
	(recalled) when a new save happens to that buffer.  This is less
	confusing.  Also fixed some malloc problems.

	* display.h, display.c:
	Added GetFile, message, and file Load/Save key text.

	* oscope.h, oscope.c:
	Moved handle_opt to new file.c, added -a and file save/load keys.

Fri Mar  1 04:27:08 1996  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* x11.c: Turned math button into a menu with current function checked.

Wed Feb 28 06:09:06 1996  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* x11.c: Initial revision

Fri Jan 19 07:12:34 1996  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* scope.c:
	Reset the sound card after each read.  This greatly improves response
	time since only the first "screenful" of the FIFO is read.  The rest
	is discarded and we start over from zero for the next screen.  This
	prevents the samples from getting backed up and overflowing the FIFO.

Wed Jan  3 06:18:57 1996  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* Makefile: Added PREFIX (for install) and VER (for dist) variables.

	Tweaked graph_data loop for efficiency (added k).
	Cleaned up usage.

	* scope.h: Added DEF_12 for new dual channel mode.

	* scope.c:

	Rearranged usage to display interactive runtime keys.

Sat Dec 30 10:30:39 1995  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* scope.c:
	Added -b and B/b keys to swap the signal and graticle front/back.

	* scope.c:
	Keys are now handled during trigger wait.  The key forces a trigger.
	Also added a horizontal time scale to the center of the graticule.

	* scope.c: T and t keys now turn disabled trigger on at 128.
	Using the keys to push trigger off scale disables it again.
	Changed functions in the loop to static inline.
	Added range forcing to -s since 0 was a fatal error.

Fri Dec 29 08:42:14 1995  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* scope.c:
	Enhanced -v to show each keypress; rearranged for readibility.

	* scope.c:
	Rearranged initialization so graticule is correct on startup.

Thu Dec 28 06:50:33 1995  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* scope.c:
	Keys are now handled while waiting on trigger.  Most won't have much
	effect until trigger is actually detected, but at least you can hit
	t/T to get the trigger back into range instead of locking up!

Wed Dec 27 08:52:01 1995  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* scope.c:
	Switched time scale to 5msec major divisions, added 0.5msec mini-ticks.

	* scope.c: Simplified verbose output to fit all parameters on one line.

	* scope.c:
	Improved triggering to see only the rising or the falling edge, not both.

	* scope.c:
	Added -s time axis Scaling (1,2,4,8,16,32) so you can zoom in/out.
	'S' key doubles it (zoom in) while the 's' key halves it (zoom out).

Tue Dec 26 13:59:25 1995  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* scope.c:
	Converted time scale to use integer math instead of floating point.

	* scope.c:
	Added time scale: 1 msec tick marks and 10 msec vertical lines.

	* scope.c: Initial revision
