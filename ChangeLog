Fri Jan 19 07:12:34 1996  Tim Witham  <twitham@eng.fm.intel.com>

	* scope.c:
	Reset the sound card after each read.  This greatly improves response
	time since only the first "screenful" of the FIFO is read.  The rest
	is discarded and we start over from zero for the next screen.  This
	prevents the samples from getting backed up and overflowing the FIFO.

Wed Jan  3 06:18:57 1996  Tim Witham  <twitham@eng.fm.intel.com>

	* Makefile: Added PREFIX (for install) and VER (for dist) variables.

	* scope.c: Fixed some off-by-one errors in dual channel mode.
	Tweaked graph_data loop for efficiency (added k).
	Cleaned up usage.

	* scope.h: Added DEF_12 for new dual channel mode.

Mon Jan  1 20:45:12 1996  Tim Witham  <twitham@eng.fm.intel.com>

	Rearranged usage to display interactive runtime keys.

Sat Dec 30 10:30:39 1995  Tim Witham  <twitham@eng.fm.intel.com>

	* scope.c:
	Added -b and B/b keys to swap the signal and graticle front/back.

	* scope.c:
	Keys are now handled during trigger wait.  The key forces a trigger.
	Also added a horizontal time scale to the center of the graticule.

	* scope.c: T and t keys now turn disabled trigger on at 128.
	Using the keys to push trigger off scale disables it again.
	Changed functions in the loop to static inline.

Thu Dec 28 06:50:33 1995  Tim Witham  <twitham@eng.fm.intel.com>

	* scope.c:
	Keys are now handled while waiting on trigger.  Most won't have much
	effect until trigger is actually detected, but at least you can hit
	t/T to get the trigger back into range instead of locking up!

Wed Dec 27 08:52:01 1995  Tim Witham  <twitham@eng.fm.intel.com>

	* scope.c:
	Switched time scale to 5msec major divisions, added 0.5msec mini-ticks.

	* scope.c: Simplified verbose output to fit all parameters on one line.

	* scope.c:
	Improved triggering to see only the rising or the falling edge, not both.

	* scope.c:
	Added -s time axis Scaling (1,2,4,8,16,32) so you can zoom in/out.
	'S' key doubles it (zoom in) while the 's' key halves it (zoom out).

Tue Dec 26 13:59:25 1995  Tim Witham  <twitham@eng.fm.intel.com>

	* scope.c:
	Converted time scale to use integer math instead of floating point.

	* scope.c:
	Added time scale: 1 msec tick marks and 10 msec vertical lines.

	* scope.c: Initial revision
