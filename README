This is "[x]oscope", a digital oscilloscope for /dev/dsp.

It is based on the original "scope-0.1" by Jeff Tranter
(Jeff_Tranter@Mitel.com) but has been greatly extended by adding text
to the display, making a resizable X client, and adding many
digital-scope-like features.  The name was changed since there is
already an xscope program that is nothing like this program.

* You will need "libsx" to get the X client (highly recommended).

* You will need "libvgamisc" from the "g3vga" kit to get text on the
  console version (highly recommended).

If you don't have both of these, or if they're in strange places, you
will need to tweak the Makefile.  See the Makefile and oscope.h for
configuration options.  If you don't have either of these, you will
have to read oscope.c or display.c and memorize the controls since
they can't be displayed on your screen (bummer!).  If I were you, I'd
get the libraries instead. :-)


INSTALLATION:

* tweak Makefile and oscope.h if necessary

* make

* make install

If you don't install as root, you will need to become root and:

* chown root oscope

* chmod u+s oscope

* chmod go-w oscope

since the svgalib can only be started by root.  xoscope doesn't
require any special permissions.


CREDITS:

Thanks to Jeff Tranter for writing the original scope-0.1

Thanks to the Cthugha-L program (Torps Productions, Harald
Deischinger) for inspiring the X11 client and some coding ideas.

Thanks to Mitch D'Souza <Mitch@Dubai.Sun.COM> for libvgamisc which
makes the 16-color console text possible.

Thanks to Dominic Giamapolo <dbg@sgi.com> for libsx which makes the
X11 client possible.
