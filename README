The latest version and more is available at:

	SUMMARY:

x*oscope is a digital oscilloscope that uses a sound card (via
/dev/dsp or EsounD) and/or Radio Shack ProbeScope (Cat. No. 220-0310)
a.k.a osziFOX as the signal input.  Either or both devices may be used
simultaneously.  You may find the manual for Radio Shack's ProbeScope
device at:

	http://support.tandy.com/support_meters/33352.htm

This device is also known as osziFOX and you may be able to get more
information on and pictures of it at:

	http://www.wtt-germany.com/index.html

http://xoscope.bstc.net/ may have pre-built binary releases and RPMs
of xoscope.  You may want to try one if you're in a hurry or if you
have problems building this from source.


	NEW for 1.6 (see also the files ChangeLog and TODO):

* EsounD (Enlightened Sound Daemon) support.  Esd is common with Gnome
  and allows xoscope to share a sound device with other programs or
  across a network.  So xoscope can now see your MP3s playing on xmms!

* GTK+ 1.2 or better is now required to build the xoscope X11 client:

  + Oft-used menus can be "torn-off" and kept available.

  + Context-sensitive pop-up menus for selecting channel, scale,
    position, memory store and recall, plot mode, trigger, etc.


	WHAT YOU NEED:

LINUX:

All things mentioned here can be obtained by anonymous ftp or the WWW.
A recent version should be available at the site listed.

* You will need a mixer program to select input source and levels.
  Examples are "gmix", "xfmix", "xmix", and "aumix".

	ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/mixers/

* You will need "GTK+" to build the X client (highly recommended).

	http://www.gtk.org/

* (outdated) OR you can use "libsx" to build an X client if you don't
  have GTK+.  You only need to make src/libsx.a then move it to
  somewhere like /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib.

	ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/devel/libraries/clibs/

* You will need "libvga" from the "svgalib" package to build the
  SVGA console version.  You may already have this in /usr/lib.

	ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/graphics/

* You will need "libvgamisc" from the "g3vga" kit to get text on the
  console version (recommended if you use the console version).  You
  only need to make misc/libvgamisc.a then move it to somewhere like
  /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib.

	ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/graphics/viewers/svga/

If you don't have these libraries, or if they're in strange places,
you will need to tweak the Makefile.  See the Makefile and config.h
for configuration options.  If you don't have GTK+, libsx or
libvgamisc, you will have to read the manual page and memorize the
controls since they can't be displayed on your screen (bummer!).  If I
were you, I'd get the libraries instead. :-)

If you have X11 and would like to do simultaneous Spectrum Analysis,
see the file README.f51 for extra optional instructions.

DOS:

I never use DOS, so I've only confirmed that it will build by cross
compiling from Linux.  I know that version 1.4 ran on DOS, so there's
no reason why this one shouldn't either.

* You will need a mixer program to select input source and levels.
  Your sound card maker probably supplied one.

* You will need DJGPP V2 and GRX20 to build from source.  Newer
  versions should work but I haven't tried them.  You will also need
  CWSDPMI or some other DPMI host.

	INSTALLATION:

LINUX:

* edit Makefile and config.h if necessary

* make

* make install

If you don't install as root, you will need to become root and:

* chown root oscope

* chmod u+s oscope

* chmod go-w oscope

since the svgalib can only be started by root.  xoscope doesn't
require any special permissions.

DOS:

* uncomment some of the DOS sections of Makefile

* make

* copy OSCOPE.EXE onto your PATH

* make sure you have CWSDPMI.EXE on your PATH


	USAGE:

Please see the man page for instructions on how to use x*oscope.  Also
use the option `-h' to show command-line options, and the `?' key to
show the key help.  If you're interested in doing advanced signal math
at run-time, see the operl and offt.c external math command examples.


	PLATFORMS:

LINUX:

/dev/dsp supported sound card or EsounD & ProbeScope/osziFOX optional

x*oscope was developed specifically for Linux on:

 - Linux kernel 1.2.10	and later on:	2.2.12
 - gcc 2.6.3				egcs 2.91.66
 - svgalib 1.2.9			1.4.0
 - libsx 1.1				GTK+ 1.0.6
 - SoundBlaster 16
 - ATI Win Turbo 2MB VRAM
 - 32MB RAM				96MB RAM
 - 100 MHz Intel Pentium(R) Processor	Celeron 300A

DOS:

sound blaster compatible card & Radio Shack ProbeScope optional

Oscope runs on DOS but with only mono (one channel) sound card
sampling, so X = Y.  ProbeScope support works on DOS.  It should also
work from Windows 3.1 or Windows 95, but may not be as stable.

x*oscope can be ported to other platforms by simply writing display
(gr_*.c) sound card (sc_*.c) and serial port (ser_*.c) connections.

	CREDITS:

Thanks to:

Jeff Tranter <Jeff_Tranter@Mitel.com> for writing the original
scope-0.1 that inspired all this.

Philip VanBaren <phillipv@eecs.umich.edu> for the realfft.c code from
his freq program.  If you want a Spectrum Analyzer, you should get
Philip's freq program and read README.f51.

The many folks working on the way cool GTK+.

The Cthugha-L program (Torps Productions, Harald Deischinger
<k3096e5@c210.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at>) for inspiring the X11 client and
some coding ideas.

Dominic Giamapolo <dbg@sgi.com> for libsx which made the original X11
client possible.  Also, freq.c and dirlist.c are from libsx.

Mitch D'Souza <Mitch@Dubai.Sun.COM> for libvgamisc which makes the
16-color console text possible (from his "g3vga").

For the DOS port, DJ Delorie (dj@delorie.com) for DJGPP and to Charles
W Sandmann (sandmann@clio.rice.edu) for CWSDPMI which together allow
the 32 bit code to work on DOS.  To Gerhard Kordmann
(kordmann@ldv01.Uni-Trier.de) for sb02.zip which made the sound card
work.  And to Sam Vincent (svincent@cs.sonoma.edu) for svasync.zip
which made the serial connection to ProbeScope possible.

Dave J. Andruczyk <dave@techdev.buffalostate.edu> for the initial
tweaks to make a connection EsounD.
