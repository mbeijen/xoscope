This is "[x]oscope", a digital oscilloscope for /dev/dsp.

It is based on "scope" by Jeff Tranter but has been greately extended
by adding text to the display and making an X client.  The name was
changed since there is already an xscope which is nothing like this
program.

You need "libmisc" from the "g3fax" kit to get text on the console
version (highly recommended).

You need "libsx" to get the X client (highly recommended).

See the Makefile and oscope.h for config options.
