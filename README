	SUMMARY:

x*oscope is a digital oscilloscope that uses a sound card (via
/dev/dsp or EsounD) and/or Radio Shack ProbeScope (Cat. No. 220-0310)
a.k.a osziFOX as the signal input.  Either or both devices may be used
simultaneously.  You may find the manual for Radio Shack's ProbeScope
device at: http://support.tandy.com/support_meters/33352.htm

This device is also known as osziFOX and you may be able to get more
information on and pictures of it at: http://www.wtt-germany.com/

Bitscope support is currently under development and is included here
only on an as-is basis.  Basic data capture may work at a fixed rate.
Advanced features such as control and subsampling are not yet
included.  For the latest bitscope development code, please check it
out from CVS on sourceforge.  Bitscope is: http://www.bitscope.com


	NEWS

Has moved to the NEWS file, complete with version history!


	INSTALLATION:

* ./configure

* make

* make install


	WHAT YOU NEED:

LINUX:

A modern Linux distribution should be able to build xoscope from
source as shown above.  If not, all things mentioned here can be found
by a search on http://www.freshmeat.net.

* You will need an audio mixer program to select input source and
  levels.  Examples are "gmix", "xfmix", "xmix", and "aumix".

* You will need "GTK+" to build the X client (highly recommended).

* OR (outdated) you can use "libsx" to build an X client if you don't
  have GTK+.  Last tried with version 2.03.

* You will need "libvga" from the "svgalib" package to build the
  SVGA console version.  You may already have this in /usr/lib.

* You will need "libvgamisc" from the "g3vga" kit to get text on the
  console version (recommended if you use the console version).  You
  only need to make misc/libvgamisc.a then move it to somewhere like
  /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib.

If you have X11 and would like to do simultaneous Spectrum Analysis,
see the file README.f51 for extra optional instructions.  WARNING: I
haven't tried this lately.

DOS:

I never use DOS, so I can't really support it.  But it worked in
version 1.4 and should still work in theory.  Please see Makefile.dos
for more information.


	USAGE:

Please see the man page for instructions on how to use x*oscope.  Also
use the option `-h' to show command-line options, and the `?' key to
show the key help.  If you're interested in doing advanced signal math
at run-time, see the operl and offt.c external math command examples.


	PLATFORMS:

LINUX:

/dev/dsp supported sound card or EsounD & ProbeScope/osziFOX optional

x*oscope was developed specifically for Linux on:

 - Linux kernel 1.2.10	and later on:	2.2.16
 - gcc 2.6.3				gcc 2.96
 - svgalib 1.2.9			1.4.2
 - libsx 1.1				GTK+ 1.2.8
 - SoundBlaster 16
 - ATI Win Turbo 2MB VRAM
 - 32MB RAM				96MB RAM
 - 100 MHz Intel Pentium(R) Processor	Celeron 300A

x*oscope can be ported to other platforms by simply writing display
(gr_*.c) sound card (sc_*.c) and serial port (ser_*.c) connections.
