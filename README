Latest official version is available by anonymous ftp at:

		ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/circuits/

The latest version, binary releases and more is available at:

		http://www.bobsplace.com/~twitham/oscope/


	SUMMARY:

x*oscope is based on the original "scope-0.1" by Jeff Tranter
(Jeff_Tranter@Mitel.com) but has been greatly extended by adding text
to the display, making a resizable X client, and adding many
digital-scope-like features.  The name was changed since there is
already an xscope program that is nothing like this program.  Also,
the name oscope makes it more obvious what this is; an oscilloscope.

http://www.bobsplace.com/~twitham/oscope/ now has pre-built binary
releases.  You may want to try one if you have problems building this
from source.  Currently the binaries were built on Linux 2.0.30, ELF.
They may or may not work on your system.


	NEW for 1.3 (see also the files ChangeLog and TODO):

* sample rate can be changed independent of horizontal scale.

* signals of any sample rate can now be stored and recalled.

* you can zoom out further to see more time (skip samples).

* math functions can now operate on memory buffers.

* display and controls rearranged slightly; a button for xy.

* the code is more modular for easier porting, see TODO #24.

* unfinished DOS (DJGPP/GRX) port is included, see TODO #24.


	WHAT YOU NEED:

All things mentioned here can be obtained by anonymous ftp from
sunsite.unc.edu or a mirror site.  A recent version should be
available in the directory listed here.

* You will need a mixer program to select input source and levels.
  Examples are "xfmix", "xmix", and "cam".

	ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/mixers/

* You will need "libsx" to build the X client (highly recommended).
  You only need to make src/libsx.a then move it to somewhere like
  /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib.

	ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/devel/

* You will need "libvga" from the "svgalib" package to build the
  SVGA console version.  You may already have this in /usr/lib.

	ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/graphics/

* You will need "libvgamisc" from the "g3vga" kit to get text on the
  console version (highly recommended if you use the console version).
  You only need to make misc/libvgamisc.a then move it to somewhere
  like /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib.

	ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/graphics/viewers/

If you don't have these libraries, or if they're in strange places,
you will need to tweak the Makefile.  See the Makefile and config.h
for configuration options.  If you don't have libsx or libvgamisc, you
will have to read the manual page and memorize the controls since they
can't be displayed on your screen (bummer!).  If I were you, I'd get
the libraries instead. :-)

If you have X11 and would like to do simultaneous Spectrum Analysis,
see the file README.freq51 for extra optional instructions.


	INSTALLATION:

* edit Makefile and config.h if necessary

* make

* make install

If you don't install as root, you will need to become root and:

* chown root oscope

* chmod u+s oscope

* chmod go-w oscope

since the svgalib can only be started by root.  xoscope doesn't
require any special permissions.


	USAGE:

Please see the man page for instructions on how to use x*oscope.
Also use the option '-h' to show command-line options.  If you're
interested in doing advanced signal math at run-time, see the operl
and offt.c external math command examples.


	PLATFORMS:

x*oscope was developed specifically for Linux on:
 - Linux kernel 1.2.10	and later on:	2.0.30
 - gcc 2.6.3				2.7.2
 - svgalib 1.2.9			1.2.10
 - libsx 1.1
 - SoundBlaster 16
 - ATI Win Turbo 2MB VRAM
 - 100 MHz Intel Pentium(R) Processor, 32MB RAM

You will probably need a fast processor and video card if you want to
see several signals in real-time.  Please let me know if it has
problems (or not) on your specific Linux system or sound card.

x*oscope could be ported to other platforms by writing display
(gr_*.c) and sound card (sc_*.c) connections.

	CREDITS:

Thanks to Jeff Tranter <Jeff_Tranter@Mitel.com> for writing the
original scope-0.1 that inspired all this.

Thanks to Philip VanBaren <phillipv@eecs.umich.edu> for the realfft.c
code from his freq program.  If you want a Spectrum Analyzer, you
should get Philip's freq program and read README.freq51.

Thanks to the Cthugha-L program (Torps Productions, Harald Deischinger
<k3096e5@c210.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at>) for inspiring the X11 client and
some coding ideas.

Thanks to Dominic Giamapolo <dbg@sgi.com> for libsx which makes the
X11 client possible.  Also, freq.c and dirlist.c are from libsx.

Thanks to Mitch D'Souza <Mitch@Dubai.Sun.COM> for libvgamisc which
makes the 16-color console text possible (from his "g3vga").
