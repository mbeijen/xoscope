This is "[x]oscope", a digital oscilloscope for /dev/dsp.

Copyright (C) 1996 Tim Witham <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

(see the bottom of this file and the file COPYING for more details)


[x]oscope is based on the original "scope-0.1" by Jeff Tranter
(Jeff_Tranter@Mitel.com) but has been greatly extended by adding text
to the display, making a resizable X client, and adding many
digital-scope-like features.  The name was changed since there is
already an xscope program that is nothing like this program.  Also,
the name oscope makes it more obvious what this is.


WHAT YOU NEED:

* You will need a mixer program to select input source and levels.

* You will need "libsx" to get the X client (highly recommended).

* You will need "libvga" from the "svgalib" package to build the
  console version.

* You will need "libvgamisc" from the "g3vga" kit to get text on the
  console version (highly recommended if you use the console version).

If you don't have these libraries, or if they're in strange places,
you will need to tweak the Makefile.  See the Makefile and config.h
for configuration options.  If you don't have libsx or libvgamisc, you
will have to read the manual page and memorize the controls since they
can't be displayed on your screen (bummer!).  If I were you, I'd get
the libraries instead. :-)


INSTALLATION:

* edit Makefile and config.h if necessary

* make

* make install

If you don't install as root, you will need to become root and:

* chown root oscope

* chmod u+s oscope

* chmod go-w oscope

since the svgalib can only be started by root.  xoscope doesn't
require any special permissions.


USAGE:

Please see the man page for instructions on how to use [x]oscope.


PLATFORMS:

[x]oscope was developed specifically for Linux on:
 - Linux kernel 1.2.10
 - gcc 2.6.3
 - svgalib 1.22
 - libsx 1.1
 - SoundBlaster 16
 - ATI Win Turbo 2MB VRAM
 - 100 MHz Intel Pentium(R) Processor, 32MB RAM

To date, this is all it has been tried on.  You will probably need a
fast processor and video card if you want to see several traces in
near real-time.  Please let me know if it has problems on your
specific Linux system or sound card.


CREDITS:

Thanks to Jeff Tranter for writing the original scope-0.1

Thanks to Philip VanBaren for the realfft.c code from his freq5.  If
you want a Spectrum Analyzer, you should get freq.

Thanks to the Cthugha-L program (Torps Productions, Harald
Deischinger) for inspiring the X11 client and some coding ideas.

Thanks to Dominic Giamapolo <dbg@sgi.com> for libsx which makes the
X11 client possible.  Also, freq.c and dirlist.c are from libsx.

Thanks to Mitch D'Souza <Mitch@Dubai.Sun.COM> for libvgamisc which
makes the 16-color console text possible.
