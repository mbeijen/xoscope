       - Ooops, GTK is LGPL'd. I have therefore changed to LGPL (again)

        - preparing GtkDatabox-0.2.0.5 for release
	- Realising that I had a mixture of some files saying that 
	  GtkDatabox is provided under LGPL, some saying GPL, I now
	  changed everything to GPL. If you want to use GtkDatabox in 
	  non-free software, please use one of the older versions or
	  contact me for a special licence for you.

        A whole bunch of small changes and a few bug fixes along 
	with the port to GTK+-2.0.0
	Among other things:

	  you can determine the drawing order much better

09.05.99 Changed comments from // to /**/ to remove problems on some systems
